**Problem Statement.**

Due to the cost of living crisis, there is an increase in demand for food banks, leading to a higher volume of donations. In order to manage these donations efficiently, food banks need to prioritise their inventory, keeping track of quantity and expiration dates. This is where Pantry-Mate comes in - **an app** designed to help food banks manage their donated items effectively. By using Pantry-Mate, food banks can reduce waste, plan for future needs, and ensure they have enough supplies to meet the needs of their community.
